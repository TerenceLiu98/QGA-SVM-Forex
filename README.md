## Main Idea

Whether it is stocks, foreign exchange or futures, they are all products of the financial market. In this market, all prices are constantly changing, and people participating in this market hope to master the law of this change and obtain benefits. Many values in the market are worthy of our attention, but the price changes that investors are most concerned about. The rise or fall of prices will affect the operation of investors. This is actually a classification problem; "What factors will cause prices to rise? Will the price fall? "This is a matter of parameter selection.

 Genetic Algorithm and SVM often appear in various new models: GA is an algorithm for evolutionary calculation of candidate solutions to optimization problems; SVM is a classification algorithm. In this article, we will no longer use traditional binary coding, but use quantum coding to implement quantum genetic algorithm, combining it with commonly used machine learning algorithms (SVM),  proposeing a method for selecting financial parameters using a combination of quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) and SVM.

## GA

GA stands for Genetic Algorithm, it is a type of Evolutionary Algorithms.

## SVM 
Support Vector Machine, a well-known Machine learning algorithm

## QGA

QGA: Quantum Genetic Algorithm, instead of binary coding, it uses quantum coding.
